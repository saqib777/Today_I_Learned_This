### Hey, its oct 20 2025 and I learnt this:

1. I learnt about codespace in Github: so its a easy to reach to your code and execute it, i knew few other ways which ofcourse I have forgotten, but this seems easy to run the code. I want to learn more about it, I have tried one folder and ran the game and everything is like VS code, The UI, working, functions, basically it is vscode inside github.
