### Hey, its oct 20 2025 and I learnt this:

1. I learnt about codespace in Github: so its a easy to reach to your code and execute it, i knew few other ways which ofcourse I have forgotten, but this seems easy to run the code. I want to learn more about it, I have tried one folder and ran the game and everything is like VS code, The UI, working, functions, basically it is vscode inside github.  

2. I learnt how to add dropdown in Excel and I also learnt data validation: 1. How to make a dropdown list: select a colum or a cell>>>click on data>>>data validation>>data validation>>under "Allow" select list>>check in-cell drop down>>>in source field>>> type what you need to add in the list>>click ok. 2. How to highlight specific text>>> click on the cell>>in Home, click conditional formatting>>New Rule>>click the second option in the list "Format the cell that only contain">>>in the "Format only cell value with" select specific text>>> Containing>> and fill the text you want to highlight in the right blank field>>click on format>>select color>>hit ok.
